	 <div class="list">
		<ul>
      		<li>2 sticks unsalted butter, softened</li>
      		<li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
      		<li>3/4 cup packed brown sugar</li>
      		<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
     		<li>2 large eggs</li>
     		<li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
     		<li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    		<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    		<li>2 cups chocolate chips</li>
    	</ul>
	 </div>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Preheat the Oven</h3>
    <p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper to prevent sticking.</p>
    <h3>Cream the Butter and Sugars</h3>
    <p>In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened butter, granulated sugar, packed brown sugar, and vanilla extract together until the mixture is creamy and smooth.</p>
    <h3>Add Eggs</h3>
    <p>Beat in the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition until the batter is well combined.</p> 
    <h3>Combine Dry Ingredients</h3>
    <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add this dry mixture to the wet mixture, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</p>

    <h3>Add Chocolate Chips</h3>
    <p>Gently fold in the chocolate chips using a spatula or wooden spoon. Make sure the chocolate chips are evenly distributed throughout the dough.</p>
    <h3>Scoop the Dough</h3>
    <p>Use a cookie scoop or a spoon to drop rounded tablespoons of cookie dough onto the prepared baking sheets. Leave some space between the cookies to allow for spreading.</p>
    <h3>Bake the Cookies</h3>
    <p>Place the baking sheets in the preheated oven and bake for about 9 to 11 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown but the centers still look slightly soft. Remember that cookies will continue to bake a little after you take them out of the oven due to residual heat.</p>
    <h3>Cool</h3>
    <p>Remove the baking sheets from the oven and let the cookies cool on the sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>
    <h2>ENJOY!</h2>
